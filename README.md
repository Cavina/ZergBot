# ZergBot
A Zerg AI Agent using Deepmind's Library

01/14/2025

Creating this initial agent was done using this article:
https://itnext.io/build-a-zerg-bot-with-pysc2-2-0-295375d2f58e

by Steven Brown, who worked on PySC2 2.0

I then integrated the additional logger and doxygen into the project.

This will be our starting point.
