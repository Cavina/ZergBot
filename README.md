# System Design Report: Post-Game Analysis Tool with LLMs

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

The purpose of this document is to outline the system design for a Post-Game Analysis Tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze game data, generate insights, and provide strategic coaching for players in real-time strategy (RTS) games, such as StarCraft II.

### 1.2 Objectives

- Capture and analyze game logs (player actions, game state, Q-values, outcomes).
- Utilize LLMs to translate raw data into human-readable strategic insights.
- Provide post-match reports with decision analysis, performance metrics, and improvement suggestions.
- Enhance learning by retrieving past similar game situations and comparing decisions.
- Deploy the system efficiently for real-time and post-game feedback.

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 High-Level Overview

The system consists of:

- **Data Ingestion Layer**: Captures game data via APIs, logs, or computer vision.
- **Data Processing Layer**: Extracts relevant state-action pairs and computes metrics.
- **Analysis & Decision Layer**: Uses LLMs & reinforcement learning models to analyze decisions.
- **Feedback & Reporting Layer**: Generates natural language explanations, heatmaps, and suggestions.
- **User Interface Layer**: Displays insights via dashboards, reports, or voice feedback.

- **Storage**: Past games stored in SQL/NoSQL & Vector Database (FAISS/Pinecone)
- **Model Deployment**: Hosted via Cloud (AWS/GCP) or local inference (Hugging Face, OpenAI API)

## 3. Key Components & Implementation

### 3.1 Data Ingestion & Preprocessing

- **Sources**: Game logs, API hooks, screen capture (computer vision for UI-based games)
- **Storage**: Structured in SQL/NoSQL databases for easy retrieval
- **Normalization**: Standardizes logs for consistency across different games

### 3.2 Analysis & Decision Explanation

- **Q-Learning/DQN Model**: Extracts expected rewards for different actions
- **LLM (GPT-4, Claude, Llama)**: Interprets game decisions and explains them in human terms
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Fetches similar past game situations for comparison

### 3.3 Feedback & Reporting

- **Real-Time Alerts**: Immediate tips during the match (optional for live coaching)
- **Post-Match Reports**: Heatmaps, best/worst decisions, missed opportunities
- **Strategic Insights**: Suggests alternative moves based on historical performance

## 4. Infrastructure & Deployment

### 4.1 Compute Resources

- **Cloud** (AWS/GCP) for scalable LLM inference
- **On-Premise**: Local inference with quantized models (GGUF/Llama.cpp for latency optimization)

### 4.2 Storage

- **Vector Database** (FAISS, Pinecone) for retrieving similar game states
- **SQL/NoSQL Databases** for structured game logs

### 4.3 API & UI

- **REST API** (FastAPI, Flask) to serve analysis results
- **Web Dashboard** (React, Django, Flask) for visualization

## 5. Challenges & Considerations

### 5.1 LLM Fine-Tuning vs. Prompt Engineering

- Fine-tuning requires labeled game data
- Prompt engineering enables flexible, general-purpose explanations

### 5.2 Real-Time Processing vs. Post-Game Analysis

- **Live Coaching** requires efficient low-latency inference
- **Post-Game Reports** allow deeper analysis with batch processing

### 5.3 Multi-Game Adaptability

- The tool should be adaptable to different RTS, MOBA, and turn-based games with minor modifications

## 6. Conclusion & Next Steps

This system design lays the foundation for an AI-powered Post-Game Analysis Tool that combines reinforcement learning, LLM-based insights, and retrieval-based strategies to enhance player learning. Future improvements include:

- Dynamic strategy adaptation based on evolving gameplay trends
- Integration with esports teams & training programs
- Automated coaching for ranked ladder progression

A Zerg AI Agent using Deepmind's Library

Creating this initial agent was done using this article:
https://itnext.io/build-a-zerg-bot-with-pysc2-2-0-295375d2f58e

by Steven Brown, who worked on PySC2 2.0

I then integrated the additional logger and doxygen into the project.

This will be our starting point.
